# Hyperwell Gateway

Implementation of a peer-to-peer (P2P) system that leverages collaboration, local-first principles, and more on [W3C Web Annotations](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/). The system provides software for local nodes that store annotations, as well as a gateway server that implements the [W3C Web Annotation Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-protocol/).

More on that: https://kassel.works/thesis

**Important**: This is alpha software for research. Your annotations will be available publicly and accessible without authentication.
